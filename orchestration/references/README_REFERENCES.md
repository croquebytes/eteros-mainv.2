# References Folder (Generic)

This folder is for **supporting material** that LLMs and humans can refer to while working
on **`PROJECT_NAME`**.

Suggested contents:

- High-level design docs and specs.
- Architecture and systems documents.
- UI/UX wireframes or notes.
- Lifecycle / monetization / campaign specs (if relevant).
- LLM session notes and logs.

This pack includes:

- `LLM_NOTES_TEMPLATE.md` – a template you can copy/rename to `LLM_NOTES.md` and keep updated.

You can add more files here (e.g. `VISION_AND_GOALS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md`, etc.)
and instruct the **Master Orchestrator** and other role prompts to read from this folder
when possible.
