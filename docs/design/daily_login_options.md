# Daily Login UI Design Options

You requested a less intrusive Daily Check-in. Here are 3 proposed designs:

## Option A: The "Compact Dialog" (Minimalist)
Reduces the footprint significantly. Instead of a full-screen overlay, it's a small, floating dialog box in the center of the screen.
- **Size:** ~400px width.
- **Content:** Shows **only today's reward** and a "Claim" button.
- **Context:** A "View Calendar" button expands it if you want to see future rewards.
- **Pros:** Fast, barely blocks the view, very clean.
- **Cons:** Hides the "streak" progression by default.

## Option B: The "Notification Toast" (Passive)
Completely removes the modal.
- **Behavior:** A sleek notification banner appears at the top-right: *"Daily Reward Available: 50 Gold"*.
- **Action:** Clicking the banner claims the reward immediately.
- **Pros:** Zero friction, zero blocking. Most "hacker" feel.
- **Cons:** Easy to miss if you're AFK. Less "celebratory" feeling.

## Option C: "Windowed App" (Integrated)
Treats the Daily Reward like any other app (e.g., Quest Explorer).
- **Behavior:** Opens as a normal window on startup.
- **Interaction:** You can drag it aside, minimize it, or snap it.
- **Pros:** Consistent with the OS desktop metaphor. User has full control.
- **Cons:** Adds window clutter on startup.

## Recommendation
I recommend **Option C (Windowed App)** to fit the "Operating System" ethos, OR **Option A** for pure efficiency.

Which direction would you like to proceed?
