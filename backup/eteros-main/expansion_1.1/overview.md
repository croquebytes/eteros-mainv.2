# Expansion 1.1 – ReincarnOS

## Overview

This expansion adds new layers of depth to **ReincarnOS**, the browser‑based OS‑style idle RPG.  It introduces a rich digital mythology, new resources and items, additional time‑sink mechanics and a suite of extra “apps” that reinforce the desktop metaphor.  The design follows idle‑game best practices of pairing a simple, low‑barrier core loop with a more complex meta loop【992881712478561†L110-L131】【992881712478561†L133-L177】, while maintaining a minimalist, unobtrusive UI【470556324449136†L70-L79】 that can sit on the user’s desktop as they work【605826546517230†L50-L56】.  The UI continues to emphasize clarity and personalization【360791380958821†L471-L487】【360791380958821†L506-L521】.

### What's Included

* **World Mythos** – a digital reincarnation narrative where souls become data processes managed by a cosmic Kernel, with factions and NPC “programs” to discover.
* **Items & Resources** – new file‑based gear, consumables and multiple currencies such as Code Fragments, CPU Cycles and Memory Blocks.
* **Time‑Sink Mechanics** – research, compilation, defragmentation and backup tasks that consume resources and time, creating meaningful choices and offline progression【992881712478561†L224-L232】.
* **Additional Apps** – new windowed applications such as Mail, News, Task Scheduler, Terminal, Antivirus and Bug Tracker, each providing unique mechanics.
* **Gameplay & Events** – dynamic quest sectors, status effects, random pop‑ups, seasonal OS updates and meaningful player choices【992881712478561†L253-L263】.

This package is structured for easy ingestion by a large‑language model (LLM).  Each file focuses on a specific aspect of the expansion and includes coding concepts and data structures to jump‑start implementation.
