# ReincarnOS Development Progress

> **Last Updated:** 2025-11-19
> **Purpose:** Track implementation progress across phased development

---

## Overview

ReincarnOS is a browser-based OS-style idle RPG built with Vite + Vanilla JS. This document tracks progress across planned phases, focusing on aligning the implementation with design reference documents.

**Core Constraints:**
- ✅ Vanilla JavaScript (no React/Vue/Angular)
- ✅ Vite build tool (dev-time only)
- ✅ Offline-capable static build
- ✅ OS desktop metaphor maintained
- ✅ localStorage persistence
- ✅ Mobile-responsive

### Recent Update – Offline Dungeon Resume (2025-11-19)
- Added timestamped `activeDungeonRun` snapshots and `pendingDungeonResult` summaries to localStorage saves so dungeon runs can be simulated while the tab is closed.
- On load, elapsed time is converted into estimated waves cleared, rewards earned, and hero HP deltas (with boss modifiers) instead of resuming the live loop.
- Quest Explorer now surfaces a “Dungeon simulated while you were away” panel showing mobs encountered, gold/XP gained, and HP changes; players must acknowledge before starting a new run.

## Phase 1 – OS Shell Foundation ✅ COMPLETE

**Date Completed:** 2025-11-19
**Goal:** Bring desktop OS experience up to reference doc vision with drag/drop, snapping, minimize, maximize, and persistence.

### Features Implemented

#### 1. Desktop State Management (`src/os/desktopState.js`) ✅
- **State Structure:** Implements reference doc Section 2 structure
  - `windows`: Window positions, sizes, states (minimized/maximized/snapped)
  - `icons`: Icon positions on desktop with grid snap
  - `taskbar`: Pinned apps and running window tracking
  - `settings`: User preferences (snap mode, grid size, theme)
- **Persistence:** All state saved to `localStorage` under `reincarnos:desktop:state`
- **Auto-restore:** Window and icon positions restored on page load
- **Debounced saves:** 500ms debounce during drag operations to reduce writes
- **Responsive grid:** 64px (desktop), 80px (tablet), 100px (mobile)

#### 2. Snap Preview System (`src/os/snapPreview.js`) ✅
- **Visual feedback:** Semi-transparent blue overlay shows snap target while dragging
- **Snap modes:**
  - **Halves:** Left half, right half, maximize (top edge)
  - **Quarters:** 4 corners (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) + halves + maximize
- **Smart detection:** 50px margin from edges triggers snap zones
- **Smooth transitions:** 150ms CSS transition for snap preview

#### 3. Enhanced Window Manager (`src/os/windowManager.js`) ✅
- **Window snapping:**
  - Drag window to edge → see snap preview → release to snap
  - Double-click titlebar → toggle maximize
  - Drag maximized window → automatically restore and continue dragging
- **Minimize/Maximize:**
  - Minimize button (−) added to title bar
  - Maximize button (□) added to title bar
  - Close button (×) retained
  - Taskbar buttons show minimized state (italic, yellow indicator)
  - Click minimized taskbar button → restore window
  - Click active taskbar button → minimize window
- **Window persistence:**
  - Positions saved on drag end
  - States saved on minimize/maximize/close
  - Restores previously open windows on page load
- **Focus management:**
  - Active window highlighted (blue glow)
  - Inactive windows dimmed (85% opacity)
  - Z-index auto-increment on focus
- **Touch support:**
  - Touch events mapped to drag operations
  - Larger touch targets on mobile (36-44px)

#### 4. Desktop Icon Drag/Drop (`src/os/desktop.js`) ✅
- **Draggable icons:**
  - Click and drag desktop icons
  - Visual feedback: 70% opacity, scale 1.05x, cursor grabbing
  - Constrain to desktop bounds
- **Grid snap:**
  - Snap to grid on release (64/80/100px based on viewport)
  - Positions saved to localStorage
  - Positions restored on page load
- **Auto-grid layout:**
  - First boot: icons arranged in 8-per-column grid
  - Subsequent boots: icons restored to saved positions
- **Taskbar enhancements:**
  - Visual states:
    - Running: Blue background, bottom border
    - Minimized: Yellow background, italic text
    - Active: Bright blue, bold, raised 1px
  - Click behavior:
    - Closed → open
    - Open + inactive → focus
    - Active → minimize
    - Minimized → restore
  - State updates every 500ms

#### 5. CSS Styling (`src/style.css`) ✅
**+280 lines added** for OS shell features:
- Drag states (icons and windows)
- Snap preview overlay
- Window control buttons (minimize/maximize/close with hover states)
- Taskbar button states (running/minimized/active)
- Responsive breakpoints (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- Touch-friendly adjustments

## Systems & Features Implementation – November 23, 2025

**Date:** 2025-11-23  
**Focus:** Core systems fixes and feature expansion  
**Branch:** `claude/fix-expand-reincarnos-01BovNuYGsCDfV1o4KfATGPv`

### Fixed Core Systems

#### 1. Prestige System (System Sigils) ✅
**Problem:** Prestige was creating brand new heroes instead of keeping existing roster.

**Solution:**
- Modified `performPrestige()` in `enhancedGameState.js` (lines 514-537)
- Heroes now persist through prestige but reset to level 1
- Equipment cleared, stats recalculated
- Skill points and unlocked nodes reset
- Hero `templateId`, `rarity`, and `name` preserved

**Updated Files:**
- `src/state/enhancedGameState.js` - Added hero reset loop in prestige
- `src/os/apps/systemSigils.js` - Updated to use `enhancedGameState` instead of `gameState`
- Fixed prestige UI to reflect "heroes kept, reset to level 1" behavior

**Result:** Players now keep their summoned heroes through prestige, maintaining roster investment while resetting power level appropriately.

---

#### 2. Skill Points on Level-Up ✅
**Status:** Already working correctly

**Verification:**
- Checked `addXpToHero()` in `heroSystem.js` (line 369)
- Confirms `grantSkillPoints(hero, 1)` called on each level-up
- Heroes created with `skillPoints = Math.max(0, level - 1)` for initial levels
- Console logging confirms skill point grants

**Result:** No fix needed - skill system functioning as designed.

---

#### 3. Dungeon Running Indicators ✅
**Problem:** No clear visual indication that dungeon was actively running.

**Solution:**
- Added prominent "RUNNING" badge to Quest Explorer controls (`questExplorer.js:22-25`)
- Badge displays when `gameState.dungeonState.running === true`
- Updated button styling with state-based classes (primary/warning)
- Enhanced progress text to show percentage when running

**UI Changes:**
- New badge element: `<div id="qe-running-badge" class="running-badge">`
- Visual: Play icon (▶) + "RUNNING" text
- Display: Flex layout, toggles visibility based on running state
- Button feedback: "Pause Dungeon" vs "Start Dungeon" text

**Result:** Players now have clear visual feedback when dungeons are actively running.

---

### New Features Implemented

#### 4. E-Buy Resource Exchange App ✅
**Purpose:** Trade gold for essential crafting resources with daily limits

**Implementation:**
- Created new app: `src/os/apps/eBuy.js`
- Registered in `mainEnhanced.js` with resource manager integration

**Features:**
- **Exchange Rates:**
  - 100 gold → 10 Code Fragments (limit: 10/day)
  - 200 gold → 5 Memory Blocks (limit: 5/day)
  - 150 gold → 50 CPU Cycles (limit: 20/day)
  - 500 gold → 2 Entropy Dust (limit: 3/day)

- **Daily Limit System:**
  - Tracks purchases in `gameState.eBuyState.dailyPurchases`
  - Automatic reset after 24 hours
  - Shows "X / Y remaining" for each resource
  - Countdown timer to next reset

- **UI/UX:**
  - Color-coded resource cards
  - Purchase buttons disabled when limits reached or insufficient gold
  - Clear feedback messages on purchase
  - Auto-refresh every 5 seconds

**State Management:**
```javascript
gameState.eBuyState = {
  lastReset: Date.now(),
  dailyPurchases: {
    codeFragments: 0,
    memoryBlocks: 0,
    cpuCycles: 0,
    entropyDust: 0
  }
}
```

**Result:** Players now have a controlled way to convert excess gold into crafting resources, preventing resource bottlenecks while maintaining economic balance.

- ⏳ Fake website browser app
- ⏳ Resource tracker in Start menu

---

### Testing Notes

**Build Status:** Dev server running successfully on `http://localhost:5173/`

**Manual Testing Needed:**
1. Prestige with existing heroes - verify they reset to level 1 with equipment cleared
2. Level up heroes - confirm skill points granted
3. Start/stop dungeons - verify RUNNING badge appears/disappears
4. E-Buy purchases - test daily limits and gold deduction
5. Daily reset - confirm E-Buy limits reset after 24 hours

**Known Issues:**
- None currently blocking gameplay

---

### Next Steps

**Recommended Priority:**
1. Add CSS styling for running badge (`.running-badge` class)
2. Test E-Buy integration with resource manager
3. Consider adding quest-like milestones to Task Scheduler
4. Implement equipment slot validation if errors occur
5. Add Start menu resource tracker widget

### Concept & Stub Additions – Pet & NetSim Browser

- Designed **Daemonling Pet** Tamagotchi system (hunger, energy, mood, stability, curiosity) with 60s decay rules, neglect spiral, and buffed recovery actions (feed, play, rest, debug, praise, co-browse). Added cosmetic/reward hooks and low-clutter UI guidance for compact pet window.
- Designed **NetSim Browser** gag app with fake URL chrome, bookmark sidebar, and scripted pages (news, weather, advisories) plus mini-games (packet pop clicker, hex-word rune builder).
- Implemented lightweight stubs: `petTerminal` shows stat bars, action buttons, and flavor log; `fakeBrowser` renders sidebar navigation, simulated history, and placeholder content/mini-games. Both are registered as desktop apps and window manager entries.

**Low Priority / Nice-to-Have:**
- Tamagotchi pet system
- Fake website browser
- Enhanced quest narrative system
